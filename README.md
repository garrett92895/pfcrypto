## Changelog

#### 02/07/18:

* Address support for referencing coins by ticker symbol. Set the personal capital security ticker to "$SYMBOL", such as "$BTC"

#### 12/14/17:

* Address support for ERC20 Tokens. Put the wallet address in the "Account Description" field in the format "erc20:address".

#### 11/21/17:

* Address support for ETH and BTC. Put the wallet address in the "Account Description" field and the "number of shares" will automatically be updated along with the current price

## 11/11/17:
* Script has been updated to perform each holding update in series to prevent securities in the same manual account from not updating.

## 09/25/17:

* To address the issue with cryptocurrencies which directly match a security found by personal capital's search (such as NEO), the script has been updated to strip everything except a-z characters in the crypto ticker.

Example: To successfully add NEO or another currency with the above issue, personal capital must not find the security. This can be triggered by adding a special character before/after the name of the currency. The extension will now work with the security ticker "$NEO" (without quotes)

## How it works:

* This extension runs whenever a user logs into personal capital. It queries coinmarketcap API for the current ticker price and executes a POST to personalcapital API on behalf of the user. If the address of the account is set in the "Account Description" field (ERC20 Tokens should be in the format "erc20:address"), the script will query blockcypher's API for the balance and use that for the number of shares.

## Usage:

* Install the extension.
* In personal capital, add a "Manual Investment Holdings" account. This is under "Add new account... more". If you already have this, you can skip this step.
* Add a holding in the account edit page. Enter the full name of the crypto currency, or the ticker symbol. Example: "BITCOIN" or "BTC". Enter the number of coins you hold (decimal is fine) and any price.
* Log out and log back into personal capital. The price will update after about 15-20 seconds and every time you log in in the future.

~~### Note: Throughout testing I found it to work best when each crypto holding is placed under its own account instead of multiple currencies in the same account. If you have trouble with currencies not updating when refreshing the page, try placing each into its own "Manual Investment Holdings" Account.~~ *Fixed in 0.0.3*

## Troubleshooting:
* Make sure the security ticker in personal capital is named the same as the 'id' field (not case sensitive) or the 'symbol' field (not case sensitive) for the coin from https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker.
  - Example: 'id' is 'bitcoin', security ticker is 'BITCOIN'
  - Example: 'symbol' is 'BTC', security ticker is 'BTC'
* When entering a security ticker, personal capital will automatically search for a description matching the ticker. If it finds a description, then the extension may not work even if you delete the auto-populated description or replace it. To prevent personal capital from finding a matching description, place a special character such as "$" at the beginning of the ticker
  - Example: Typing in the security ticker 'OMG' will automatically fill the description with and prevent the extension from working. Typing '$OMG' for the ticker does not have a matching description and allows the extension to work.
* If the price is updated for an ERC20 token but not the shares then it may be that the ERC20 token is not listed in the API. To check which tokens appear under your address, go to `https://ethplorer.io/address/<youraddress>`

## Notes:

* The button in the top right of chrome is not necessary and it can be hidden by right clicking on it and selecting "Hide in chrome menu". Google chrome forces an icon, there is no way to default hide it.

## Development:

* Clone repo
* Navigate to chrome://extensions
* Click 'load unpacked extension'
* Navigate to repo folder and load

## Roadmap:

* Mint support
